Welcome to the Vivo Website Project. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the project locally, detailing the project overview, technologies used, setup instructions, and team information.

## Project Overview

The Vivo Website is a sleek, responsive site showcasing Vivoâ€™s latest flagship phones with key features like interactive carousels, limited-time offers, testimonials, and a contact form. The site design uses vibrant Vivo-branded colors to enhance its appeal.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content pages.
- **CSS3**: To style the website and make it responsive across different devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactive elements like carousels and form validation.
- **Flexbox & CSS Grid**: Used for a modern, flexible layout.
- **Forms and Animations**: For improved user interaction.
