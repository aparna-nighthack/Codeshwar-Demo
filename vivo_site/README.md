Welcome to the Vivo Website project! This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting it up locally, running the website, and a brief description of each file included in the project.

## Project Overview

The Vivo Website is a user-friendly and responsive web application showcasing Vivoâ€™s latest phones. It features taglines like "Innovation Meets Elegance," highlights flagship devices such as the X100 Pro, V30, and T3 5G with specifications and images, and includes interactive carousels for key features, limited-time offers, testimonials, a contact form, and a footer with social links and newsletter signup. The design embraces vibrant Vivo-branded background colors and centers all content on the webpage.
