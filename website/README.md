- **Bootstrap 5**: For streamlined, responsive UI components.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) for testing.
- A local development server such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (for VSCode) is recommended for live reloads.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd website
   ```

3. **Open index.html** via a live server:
   - If using VSCode, right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

### Local Development

- **Styles and Scripts**: Modify `styles.css` and `scripts.js` to adjust styling or behavior. Changes are automatically reflected if using a live server.

### Environment Variables

- **API Keys**: Place any API keys required for integration in a `.env` file at the project's root. Ensure they are included in calls within `scripts.js`.

## Deployment

1. **Choose a Hosting Provider**: We recommend platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for ease of deployment.

2. **Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**: Follow your hosting provider's instructions to map a custom domain.

3. **Deploy the Website**:
   - Upload the entire `website/` directory to your chosen platform.
   - Set any necessary environment variables or API keys in your hosting provider's dashboard.
